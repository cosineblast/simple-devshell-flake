# simple-devshell-flake

This is a very small template for begginers using nix flakes.

Nix flakes was confusing to me at first, because all I wanted was a simple 
way to provide a `nix.shell` equivalent flake, which was not something 
the default `nix flake init` provided.

To use it, you can do `nix flake init -t github:cosineblast/simple-devshell-flake`.

If you end up using it often, I recommend adding some alias of it to your shell config.
